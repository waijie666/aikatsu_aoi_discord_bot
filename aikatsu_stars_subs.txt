I can't match her in anything I do.
I can't match Laura as I am now.
I can't move a muscle...
I can't really hear you.
I can't remember a thing.
I can't say. All the talent in the world means
I can't say. Even all the talent in the world means
I can't say for certain.
I can't say for sure.
- I can't say I appreciate your tardiness on day one.
I can't say I understand
I can't say that I understand
I can't say whether it's
I can't see the path I'm supposed to take.
I can't see where I'm going...
I can't see you any other way.
I can't sense the slightest
I can't stand it!
I can't stand this!
I can't stand to stay still right now.
I can't stand when people
I can't stop crying!
I can't stop myself!
I can't surpass myself
I can't take any more!
I can't take credit...
I can't tell them apart at all.
I can't tell what I got wrong.
"I can't throw beans at my senpai."
I can't understand a girl's
I can't understand you through the crying!
I can't wait!
I can't wait another second.
I can't wait for Hime-senpai's concert!
I can't wait for the festival!
I can't wait meow!
I can't wait to hear Yume-chan sing!
I can't wait to relax at home...
I can't wait to see!
I can't wait to see
I can't wait to see how the movie ended up.
I can't wait to see it!
I can't wait to see tomorrow
I can't wait to see what
I can't wait to see what kind
I can't wait to see where

I chose this.
I clear this stage and perform.
I come in last all the time.
I completely ruined my performance
I concur.
I consider you the greatest actor ever.
I convinced myself I had
I could climb anything!
I could do just fine
I could eat them right up.
I could feel it in my bones that
I could feel it when we
I could go for some ice cream.
I could hardly believe
I could hardly believe it when I saw that the
I could hardly believe it when the morning drama
I could never catch you.
I could never forget.
I could never forget it.
I could not be more pleased.
I could not have predicted from our first encounter
I could not have without you.
I couldn't...
I couldn't ask for a better opponent.
I couldn't ask for a better rival!
I couldn't ask for more!
I couldn't be happier.
I couldn't believe my eyes
I couldn't be more prepared.
I couldn't care less about M4!
I couldn't care less about the outcome.
I couldn't feel it at all!
I couldn't grab any!
I couldn't have become the
I couldn't have done it without you.
I couldn't have done it without you both.
I couldn't have expected it...
I couldn't have found it without you.
I couldn't have made my Rainbow
I couldn't have won it without you.
I couldn't help but imagine—
- I couldn't help but imagine, if this moment were to last forever,
- I couldn't help but imagine— that if this moment could last forever,
I couldn't help but take a breather.
I couldn't help it! As I was baking it with my thoughts
I couldn't help it! I kept thinking of
I couldn't help myself and...
I couldn't just sit there and do nothing.
I couldn't make a single sale.
I couldn't possibly refuse.
I couldn't possibly show my face
I couldn't resist giving everyone
I couldn't see any sparklies in her.
I couldn't see anything!
I couldn't show any results.
I couldn't stand it.
I couldn't tell you this before, but after
I couldn't win.
I could once only dream of.
I could only get it after I was
I could see Laura-chan.
I could see you doing...
- I could've never imagined so many people would show up.
I crashed and burned on stage
I cried and felt lost.
- I'd be a fool to let it go now!
I'd be ashamed if I didn't.
I'd be disheartened if
I'd be hard-pressed not to.
I'd be hard-pressed not to
I'd be honored!
I'd call this a pretty nice boat.
I'd do anything at all you
idea to change your perspective.
I decided not to get sad until after.
I decided to change classes
I decided to create a dress to draw out
I decided to create a dress to draw out her
I decided to go to Hollywood.
I decided to reform our unit.
I decided to release the seal.
I decided to transfer
I declare it!
I definitely couldn't have done it alone.
I definitely want to get my own!
Identify yourself!
identity as an attendant to the Sea King?
identity is the first step to individuality.
I devote myself to Elza!
I'd forgotten.
I'd forgotten about it since I moved into
I'd get to eat yummy sweets from around the world.
I'd given up hope, but she
I'd have won by a landslide.
I'd hit a wall in my dress designing.
I did.
I did, but hearing Lily-senpai sing
I did, but Lily-senpai's performance
I did it!
I did it! I passed!
I did it! I really did it!
I did it! Thanks, everyone!
I did it, Yume!
I did my very best!
I didn't!
I didn't.
I didn't, actually.
I didn't come intending to be stopped here.
I didn't do this just
I didn't expect Elza-san to be here.
I didn't expect her to turn it
I didn't expect that kind
I didn't expect to end up in
I didn't get any points from the Amazing Idol
I didn't get a special Grade-up Glitter.
I didn't hear anything about that!
I didn't know Aikatsu could be this fun.
I didn't know the admins
I didn't know you could find
I didn't know you could hold such an awesome
I didn't mean it like that.
I didn't mean to butt in.
- I didn't put sugar in it, so it's okay to drink at night.
I didn't realize at all.
I didn't realize how much time had
I didn't really do much beforehand.
I didn't really understand back then,
I didn't take you for the type
I didn't think I'd ever hear those
I didn't think you'd actually know I
I didn't want anybody to think I was
I didn't want to call you until
I... didn't want to lose to Yume again.
I did. She was the idol
I did think about it...
I disagree.
I discovered my purpose.
I dislike repeating myself,
I distressed over whether I had hurt someone dear
I'd like to ask Tamagorou-sensei
I'd like to ask you to lend
I'd like to begin the information

If I had to say...
If I had to say, you're the outsider here.

If I lose here...
If I may, what's that?
If I may, what was this show
If I might ask...
if I'm only having fun.
if I'm really scouted?

It was a boring one anyway.
It was a clash of our emotions.
It was actually drippy soba that I had.
It was a happy miscalculation that the students of
It was a huge success!
It was a little last-minute.
It was all Aria-chan's doing.
It was all due to you.
It was all due to your company.
It was all just for the drama?
It was all just so incredible.
it was all so I could meet you.
It was all this Ouroscopyosaurus's fault.
It was a lot of fun watching

It was false!
It was fantastic seeing you float down from the sky and

It was fantastic. You were both radiant.
It was good. That was a difficult
It was her kindness that inspired me.
It was Hime-senpai, right?
It was how I made friends who I could share
It was inevitable.
It was interesting experiencing
It was interesting experiencing all
It was just a feeling.
It was just as you said, Koharu.
It was just delivered express.

it was the obvious thing to do.
It was the phrase "everyone shine" that caught my

It was the same for me.
It was the same for me. Winning was my way of
It was the same for S4, but seeing M4 have their own
It was the same with me.
It was "the true treasure

It won't break when dropped.
It worked!
it would actually happen,
It would be a waste to eat!
It would be a waste to eat this!
- It would be best to use Dress Make specifically for our unit.
It would be foolish to hinder you now.
It would be harder to talk
It would be impossible for me to surpass
It would be improper for the hosts
it would be Mount Fuji!
It would be nice to design something
- It would be nice to make something just for our unit with Dress Make.
it wouldn't be canceled.
It wouldn't be interesting without change.
it would only make sense to ask second place.
It would surely suit you wonderfully.

I used every single one of you just
I used stars as a motif to
I used the frustration of losing in the

I was a huge fan of Yuri-senpai's
I was also on my way to retrieve
I was also on my way to retrieve something
I was astounded.
I was a tad shocked when I heard
I was at the bookstore...
I was at the end of my line there.
I was blown away the moment
I was blown away when I
I was bringing guests!
I was by myself, but never alone.
I was certain it was this floor...
I was certain this was the floor...
I was chasing after Onee-chan
I was chasing Onee-chan's back
I was concerned for Yume since she's been
I was confident enough.
I was confident I
I was confident I wouldn't cry.
I was convinced that the most powerful

- I was dropped off at the harbor and ran here as fast as I could!
I was expecting this.
I was finally able to commit.
I was finally able to sing in my own voice!
I was finally reunited with Yume-chan
I was forbidden from
I was fully expecting a refusal.
I was fully prepared to be refused.
I was gaming before the tests, so I hid here.

I was just saying how I feel!
I was just thinking about you.
I was just thinking how
- I was just thinking how difficult it is to move hearts.
- I was just thinking how it's not easy to set someone's heart into motion.
I was just thinking that I didn't want to
I was just thinking you'd be coming soon.
- I was just thinking you'd come to see me again.
I was just up here
I was kicked out of Venus Ark, and
I was naïve.
I was never really invested
I wasn't able to speak smoothly
I wasn't enjoying Aikatsu to the
I wasn't expecting all this.

that I'm strongest when the chips are down.
that I'm your sister.
that includes me.
That includes you too, Rei-san!
that in itself is not necessarily bad.
That inspired him to create konpeito
That inspired me to bring her over here.
that I perform a duet with her.
that I put in everything I've got.
That is...
That is a good way to put it.
That is a stunning amount of chocolate.
That is certainly nostalgic.
That I shall.
That is how we see it as well.
That is, I'm looking for an
That is indeed the truth.
That is just one opinion.
that is loved by all.
That is my duty as their headmaster.
that is my individuality!
That is my new dream.
That is my reason for wanting to join S4.
That is my will, my passion, and my dream!
That is not beautiful!
That isn't...
That isn't all.
That isn't the case.
That isn't true.
that I started taking lessons!
That is the applied moonwalk!
That is the basis for
That is the essence of self-production.
That is the one thing
That is the way of the Bird Theater Class.
That is this charming
That is to Aikatsu in a healthy body!
That is true of both cakes and dresses.
That is unnecessary.
That is what makes us shine ever brighter!
That is what you must never forget.
That is when I met Elza!
- That is why I came out in my everyday clothes.
That is why I chose to come
- That is why I deliberately came out in my everyday clothes.
That is why I want to
That is why this year
that is winning the Aikatsu Ranking!
That is yet another saying.
that I thought would look nice.
That it is.
That, itself, is the key to true strength!
that it's hard to talk to her.
that it's too different.
that it would help me learn to be assertive,
that I wanted to be muses with you.
that I wanted us to be muses together.
that I wasn't wrong!
that I was the prime candidate.
that I was unable to make my own chocolate this year.
that Jack-o'-lantern?
That just makes me want to meet her more!
That just means you're
That just shows how hard you're working.
That kind of coord and sense!
that Laura-chan's is much cuter.
That Laura's got a totally different
That Laura's leaving with a
that leads one to a deep understanding of the soul.
That leaves Mahiru-chan as the
That leaves only Mahiru-chan without an S.
That leaves only the final point.
That leaves the quality of beauty as
that lets everyone shine their brightest.
that lets me create novel Dress Makes.
- That level of resolution is necessary to keep up with the idol pirate unafraid of storms.
That'll be my new goal.
that'll be perfect for your promotion.
That'll do it for the first half!
That'll make the time until
That location catches my eye.
That looked suspiciously like a confession.
That looks delicious!
That looks good!
That looks good on you.
That looks interesting.
That looks like fun!
That looks like fun. Mind if we join?
That looks like hard work.
that M4's tackling the rest of Asia.
That majestic lake on the way to the
That makes five.
That makes it all the more important
that makes me happier.
That makes nine of us!
That makes Onee-chan so happy!
That makes sense!
That makes sense.
That makes sense. You've
That makes six.
That makes the third
That makes this a battle for the center!
That makes three from Four Star Academy.
That makes Yuzukoshou.
That many?!
That may be so, but before
That may be true...
That may be true, but coming in
That means...
That means a lot coming from you.
That means I need to work even harder.
That means I need to work twice as hard.
That means it didn't approve her
That means it's time for
That means she wasn't accepted to
That means so much!
That means so much to me.
That means the possibilities are endless!
That means they had to find time in
That means they had to find time to
That means they must be holding a
That means we'll have full creative
That means you must be
That means you must be competing
That means you're the top first-year
That meant you're the top
That meeting...
That mindset is why your investigative
that motto come from?
that much fun in a while!
That much is nothing. The foundation
that much is to be expected.
- That must be because you're always right next to the lofty goal of your sister.
That must be because you're constantly reminded
- That must be because your sister's presence constantly reminds you of the lofty goal you have.
That must be Hoo-chan's family!
That must be it.
That must be what it means
That must be what it really
That must be why the train stopped.
That must've been my sister.
that my place was with Ichigo and Aoi.
That name sounds familiar...
That night, Elza-san and her
That night, I felt the touch of fate.
that Nijino's group has been suppressing.
that Nijino's group have been suppressing.
That Nijino Yume girl
That nobody cares.
that no matter how much I hurt, I could get back
that no matter how much it hurt, I could muster the
That octo!
That octopus!
That once you finished your duty as
That once you finished your duty in S4,
That one idol still hasn't been heard from.
That only motivates me more.
that opportunity comes...
that opportunity to steal the diamond.
that ordinary-looking muffin with wasabi!
that our viewers feel the same way.
That owl...
That page has garnered a huge following.
That pair are pro dancers
That part goes like this!
That part of Yume-chan hasn't changed one bit
that Perfect Elza straight to her face.
That perks me right up.
That person for me is
That person is...
That person must have been looking
That phrase...
That phrase is actually a metaphor
That piano...
That picture is me-from-the-past.
That power...
that power at some point.
that power, I went straight to Hikaru.
That Premium Rare Dress, blooming like a
That Premium Rare Dress blooms like a
that previous S4 members wore.
That production was just a plot to
That program...
That promise...
that pulls high ratings.
that reaches her readers.
That really came out of nowhere.
That really hurts!
That reminds me, didn't you announce a new song at the
That reminds me, Kirara.
That reminds me, Koharu-chan said she
That reminds me, Koharu-chan says she's
That reminds me that Laura's
That reminds me that you announced a new song at
that request without even a rehearsal.
That result is perfectly fine. It just serves
That room...
that run around this time every year
- That's...
That's...
That's absolutely better than before!
That's a good girl.
That's a good observation.
That's a good thing! It's
That's a handmade smoothie
That's a healthy appetite.
That's a hundred twenty points.
That's a hundred-twenty points.
That said, act in accordance with
- That said, I just won in rock-paper-scissors against the rest.
That said, it's about time to pass out the most
That said, it's about time to pass out the rockingest
That said, Laura has
That said, Yume-chan
That's all!
That's all.
That's all from us in the field.
That's all! Get on it!
That's all! Get out, and get on it!
That's all. Head out. Get on it.
That's all I ask of you.
That's all I can ask for.
That's all? If you want, you're
That's all in the past.
That's all right, you go first.
That's all that was worrying you?
That's all the more reason to do it.
That's all there is to it.
That's all you've been
That's a lovely outfit.
that's always supported me.
That's a mascot character!
That's amazing!
That's amazing...
That's amazing.
That's amazing! I wonder how it feels
That's amazing, Koharu!
That's amazing, Koharu-chan!
That's amazing, she's acting so bold in
That's amazing. She's being so forward
That's amazing, Yume-chan.
That's an absolute waste!
That's a new record!
That's a nice expression, Koharu-chan.
That's a nice meaning.
That's an intriguing view.
That's another place we
That's a rather packed schedule.
That's a real passion for Aikatsu!
That's a real variety of work.
That's a relief.
That's a result of bringing the
That's a secret!
That's a secret for now!
That's a simple matter.
That's astounding, Yuzu-senpai!
- That's a surprise until you see it.
That's awesome!
That's awesome.
That's awesome! I wish I could've entered.
That's awesome, Koharu!
That's awesome, Laura! You made it!
That's awful! Laura was so
That's a wonderful aspiration!
That's a wrap!
That saying...
That's because Elza-sama's the owner.
That's because I have
That's because... I'm in love.
That's because I still have
That's because it was! You were off
That's because I've got to grow even more.
That's because rainbows
That's because the main event's gonna be a
That's because the main event will be a
That's Berry Parfait! That's why...
that's beyond my reach.
That scared me.
That scares me.
That's 'cause summer's right
That's cause summer's right
That's 'cause when I eat bananas...
That's certainly a dress befitting
That's correct.
That's correct! Please read
That script was pretty tough.
That's darn intriguing.
That's definitely a design that only a
That's definitely baa!
That's definitely part of it,
That's definitely true. Yume-chan
that sea cucumber scared you.
That's easy for you to say.
That's easy to say, but I still
That secret will be
That seems like fun. Maybe
That's... Elza-san?
That's Elza-san for you!
That's Elza-san for you.
That's enough!
That's enough...
That's enough.
That's enough already.
That's enough! We're wrapping up for today!
That's everything I wanted to say to you!
That's exactly it. They're
That's exactly right.
That's exactly the problem.
That's exactly what I wanted to hear!
That's exactly why I try to provide strict guidance and
- That's exactly why the sense of accomplishment you feel after you learn it makes for an even more incredible dance.
That's exactly why you're so
That's fine and all, but aren't
That's fine, then. Just don't overdo it!
That's fine, Yume-chan.
That's for certain.
That's for the best.
That's from...
That's from China.
That's girl's so over the place
That's good.
That's good then. I wouldn't want to have
That's good, then. You'll be fine.
That's good to hear.
That's great!
That's great, but do we
That's great, but why did
That's great! I know you'll
That's great, Koharu-chan.
That's great. Please be
That's great. Please take
That's great progress!
That's great. You can do it!
That's great, Yume!
That's harsh... That's
That she is.
That's her.
That's her over there.
that she's closing Venus Ark.
that she's going to retire if she wins.
that Shiny Smile dress!
that Shiratori-san had that power.
That should be enough...
That should make it easier to decide.
That shouldn't come as a surprise.
- That should've been obvious...
That's how a boiled octopus should be.
That's how amazing Elza-sama is!
That's how a single performance
That's how cooking should be.
That's how dresses are turned into cards.
That shower of feathers made
That's how it looks to me, at least.
That's how me, Laura, and Mahiru-chan
That's how much I weigh!
That's important.
That's impressive.
That's incomparably better than before!
That's incredible.
That's it!
That's it for today!
That's it for tonight.
That's it! If that's true, then I...
That's it! I'm actually right in
That's it. I need to be
That's it! I should get my own brand.
That's it! I've been inspired!
That's it! Kirara's coming too!
That's it, Laura!
That's it, she's using her love as a spice.
That's... It's obviously to win, isn't it?
That's it! Sometimes it's a
That's it! Sometimes it's a good
That's it! That's definitely best!
That's it! This is exactly
That's just how I've always
That's just like you.
That's just the mood I'm in.
That's just the way you would phrase it.
That's Kasumi Mahiru.
That's lazy thinking. The judges want
That's Lily's way of life.
That's lovely!
That's me!
That's mean!
that's mine alone if I use this Glitter?
That's more like it.
That's more than enough.
That's my Ayumi-san!
That's my daughter out there!
That's my Lilienne!
That's my line.
That's my line! Thank you for getting
That's my Subaru-kyun!
That's Naruse Ayumi to you.
That's nerve-wracking.
That's nice and simple!
- That's nice to hear.
That's no abbreviation!
That's no good. How are you supposed
That's nonsense!
- That's no problem. I didn't intend this to be a secret conversation anyway.
That's no problem. I wasn't intending
- That's no problem, I wasn't intending for this to be a secret conversation.
That's not a bad idea, but I think talking
That's not an abbreviation!
That's not a real answer...
That's not a real hint!
That's not enough.
That's not exactly right, but anyway!
That's not how it goes. Don't
That's not it.
That's not it. I just wasn't alone.
That's not my style.
That's not our only goal today.
That's not something just
That's not the right line, you...
That's not true!
That's not true.
That's not true! Are you
That's not true at all!
That's not true! Do you not remember?
That's not true. I didn't do it by myself.
That's not true, you were a huge help.
That's not what distracted me. I was just thinking
That's not what I'm asking...
That's not what I mean.
That's not what I meant!
That's not what I meant.
That's not what it means.
That's okay. I'm sorry I
That sometimes your performances are so amazing
That's one long title!
That's one of my goals.
That's only made it more difficult to
That sound!
That sounds beautiful. Let's make
that sounds complicated.
That sounds cool.
That sounds easy!
That sounds exciting.
That sounds fanciful.
That sounds fun!
That sounds good.
That sounds good! Mahiru, is
That sounds great to me.
That sounds just like...
That sounds kind of
That sounds like a ton of fun!
That sounds like fun!
That sounds like it may be fun as well.
That sounds like it would be difficult.
That sounds nice.
That sounds rough.
That sounds so cool!
That sounds splendid.
That sounds tough.
- That sounds very intriguing.
That's our girl.
That's our living grab bag, Koharu-chan!
That's our master of dresses, Lily-senpai!
That's our rolling stone, Yuzu!
That's our Yuzu-senpai!
That sparkling feeling I got when
That's part of it, but I also want all of the
- That's part of it, but I also want the shop owners and workers to enjoy it too.
That's Perfect Elza for you.
That's perfect! You should have a
That's poetic.
That spot in S4 belongs to me.
That's precisely why.
That's preposterous!
That's pretty darn good.
That's pretty free-spirited of her.
That's pretty heavy first
That's pretty much the same thing!
That's pretty normal. What a relief.
That's probably why some girls
That's projection.
That's proof that you're serious.
That's quite intriguing.
that's radiant, it's Yume!
That's reassuring!
That's ridiculous...
That's right!
That's right...
That's right.
That's right! And hey, speak for yourself.
That's right. And I would like to thank all
That's right! Anyone's free to participate.
That's right. Berries are his favorite.
That's right. Even the Aikatsu
That's right... Everyone has
That's right, how are things
That's right! Hula dance isn't just for
That's right. I agree.
That's right! I met everyone,
That's right! I should invite
That's right! It may be
That's right, it's just about Tanabata.
That's right! It was a very
That's right. I want everyone who
That's right. I was in
That's right, I was on stage...
That's right! Let's do our best!
That's right, look straight ahead.
That's right. Nice to
That's right. Our song's
That's right. Raising the younger
That's right. She's always saying how amazing you
That's right. These are the
That's right. The song's
That's right. They were
That's right. This Blooming Queen Coord will take
That's right. This coord was made
That's right. This coord was made for
That's right, this is absolutely
That's right, this is a proper job.
That's right. This is no time
That's right, this is why
That's right. This is work for us.
That's right, this song
That's right, this song is my way of life.
That's right! Tristar is unbeatable!
That's right up Lily-senpai's alley.
That's right. We'll be filming at different
That's right, we'll be third-years soon...
That's right, we never held the
That's right. We've got meetings every day,
That's right, we've invited these two
That's right! We've invited these two
That's right. We won't lose.
That's right. We wrote the song
That's right! You even came to the
That's right, you two will be making
That's right. You two will be making
That's right, Yume-chan will
That's right, Yuzu-senpai.
That's right! Yuzu's record is actually...
That's right! Yuzu's top
That's S4's Christmas concert.
That's S4's dorm?!
That's so cool!
That's so cute!
That's so cute! I'm getting into this!
That's so generic.
That's so heartwarming!
That's so lovely!
That's some determination.
That's some guts you've got.
That's some incredible work ethic.
That's some nice rock!
That's some professionalism,
That's some taste.
That's something you can't do without
That's something you should
That's special Grade-up Glitter!
That's splendid.
That's still a secret!
That's still a secret for now!
That's still three short...
That's strange, just where is it?
That's strange. Just where is it?
That's such a funny coincidence.
That's such a waste!
That stance...
That startled me.
That's that, and this is this.
That's the Demon Lord's castle.
That's the end of the first half!
That's the forbidden room from the rumors.
That's the former ace
That's the game!
That's the gist of things, so get
That's the kind of Aikatsu
That's the kind of person my sister is!
That's the last big event
That's the modeling advice
That's the moment my dream was born.
That's the one!
That's the one.
That's the one thing you must never forget.
That's the part about you...
That's the plan, yes...
That's the power of an
- That's the power of an unquestioned queen in S4.
That's the rockingest thing ever, baby!
That's the rumored forbidden room.
That's the secret.
That's the secret to victory.
That's the spirit!
That's the spirit.
That's the spirit, Koharu-chan!
That's the spirit, Mahiru-chan.
That's the spirit of self-production!
That's the super ultimate
That's the Teacher Time alert!
That's the thing. Juli-san...
That's the Tundra Diva for you.
That's the Tundra Diva, Shirogane Lily-san!
That's the Tundra Dive for you. She is
That's the way!
That's the way.
That's the way! Now, two!
That's the way, positivity is the best!
That's the way. Positivity is the best!
That's thirty whole minutes! Could you
- That's this week's recording.
That's time!
That's too bad.
That's too bad. I'll
That's too sudden... I couldn't possibly!
That's true...
That's true.
That's true. I'll try to do so myself.
That's true. I'll try to emulate it.
That stuff's totally possible.
That stupid shoebill wasn't cool at all.
That's two Aikatsu girls who fell down!
That Subaru-kyun boy!
that suits you, the show begins!
That summarizes the post-play
that's uniquely mine.
That's usually her best point, too.
That's usually her biggest strength, too.
That's very simple.
That's very wonderful!
That's what had you stumped?
That's what happens when you
That's what happens when you rush
That's what I believe.
That's what I like to hear!
That's what I like to hear
That's what I should be saying!
That's what I thought at first too.
That's what I thought. You weren't
That's what it means to be true rivals.
That's what I wanted to hear.
That's what I wanted to say.
That's what I want to be.
That's what I want to do...
That's what I want to hear.
That's what I want to know!
That's what I want to say.
That's what makes fashion so interesting!
That's what makes Hime-senpai so wonderful.
That's what makes me so
That's what makes things interesting.
That's what makes you a daughter
- That's what she's thinking.
That's what she's waiting for!
That's what three wins gets you.
That's what we can do right now!
That's what you get from Four Star Academy.
That's what you get from S4,
That's what Yozora-senpai told you?
That's when I learned that I
That's when I thought about how I
That's where I first saw
That's why...
That's why having someone close by to show
That's why I absolutely can't lose!
That's why I at least want to make
That's why I believe we must plan to put in a
That's why I believe we must prepare a
That's why I believe we must prepare an
That's why I can't afford to
That's why I can't afford to lose!
That's why I can't be with her.
That's why I don't have the
That's why I entrusted S4 to her.
That's why I figured Elza-san must be up
That's why I find this so intriguing.
That's why I'm sitting it out.
That's why I said to let me do it!
That's why I said you
That's why it feels so good
That's why I think this'll
That's why I trained so
That's why I try to provide strict guidance to the students,
That's why I want all of you out
That's why I wanted us
That's why I wanted you to come and watch.
That's why I want to borrow Koharu-chan's
That's why I want to deliver a Christmas song to
- That's why I want to deliver a Christmas song to everyone who has to work and can't go to a party.
- That's why I want to deliver a Christmas song to everyone who has to work or can't go to a party.
That's why I want to express
That's why I want to express my gratitude.
That's why I want to ignite a light in
That's why I want to lead
That's why I want to make a
That's why I want to sing it while
- That's why I want to sing it while holding everyone's emotions close.
- That's why I want to sing it while hugging everyone's emotions close to my chest.
That's why she wants her to learn from various
That's why, today...
That's why we've decided
That's why you can't run away
That's why you can understand their
That's why you never run away
That's why you shouldn't have any regrets.
That's wonderful!
That's wonderful! Sky-Girl
That's your individuality!
That's Yozora for you! Yet another
That's Yume-chan's bright idea!
That's Yume-chan, the rainbow idol.
That test is the Powerful Race Stage.
that the Aikatsu Ranking was bad.
that the future affords to me
that the idols of Four Star Academy had arrived.
that their talent is what sinks them in the end.
that the library had on record.
that there's so much more I can do!
That there was something I was lacking.
That there was something I was missing.
that they send their staff to us.
that they wish to shine for themselves or their fans.
That thing you're holding...
that this is what Koharu would have done.
that throw the brand off its image?
that to Elza-sama is baa!
That too would be interesting,
that to the MC secrets I shared with you.
That transfers directly
That uniform...
that used to be filled with Venus Ark idols!
that used to be full of only Venus Ark idols!
that've caught your eye recently?
that Venus Ark would be shutting its doors.
That voice...
That was a battle for the ages.
That was a blast!
That was a difficult role,
That was admirable.
That was a fabulous performance.
That was a fabulous way
That was a fantastic performance.
That was a fantastic stunt!
That was a great performance!
That was a great song!
That was a job well done,
That was all intended for Subaru.
That was a lovely performance, Elza-san.
That was a magnificent deduction.
That was a marvelous show.
That was amazing!
That was amazing, Ako-chan!
That was an amazing performance, Yume!
That was a nice expression! Thank you!
That was a perfect performance.
That was a phenomenal
That was astounding.
That was a superb smile!
That was a trap.
That was back when we were children.
That was close.
That was dangerous!
That was exemplary.
That was explosively awesome!
That was fantastic.
That was fantastic, Koharu-chan!
That was far beyond my expectations.
That was fun!
That was great, Koharu and Yume!
That was Hime-senpai's answer
That was hot!
