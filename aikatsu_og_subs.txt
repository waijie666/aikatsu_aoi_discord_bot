I'd suggest you turn yourselves in.
I'd suppose so...
I'd sure love to.
I'd sure love to give it a try.
I'd take 'em on as my wife.

It all looks so good! Let's dig in!

It became a wonderful summer memory
It befits Fujiwara-honey to
It began out of her
It began when I was inspired
It began when one of Mizuki-sama's
It began when she was young.
It blew me away.
It bloomed! And look how pretty it is!
it bloomed into something bigger
- It blooms brilliantly and returns happiness back to everyone.
It blooms brilliantly and then
It blows the loneliness away!
It blows the sadness away!
It brings back a lot of memories.
It brings back memories of
It brings back the feelings I
It brings out your cute inner charm
it brings this long-awaited day.
it builds all sorts of hype.
It builds publicity for the publication
It burns hotly and cannot be stopped

it, but somehow...
it, but thinking back, I...
It came!
it came as a real shock.
It came as a shock.
- It came, Otome-chan!
it came out of nowhere,
It came to me after hearing
It came to me after watching
It came to me when I saw you on that slide.
It came with a message.
It came with a message
It can be said that what the
It can cross over any time and space
- It can only be tilled once a year.
It can't be... all the
It can't be... in any case,
It can't be Sena-san.
It can't come soon enough.
It can tell that, too?
It certainly does calm the heart.
It certainly does suit the two of you.
It certainly draws much interest.
It certainly is.
It certainly is about the right time.
It certainly is girly and cute.
It certainly isn't boring.
It certainly isn't easy.
It certainly is something
It certainly was.
It cleared up! The sunlight is perfect!
It comes from "twin wings".
It completely goes against her image

It could be nice to have a pose
it could even make us reconsider
it could flip even the common
it could make everyone cheerful and happy.
It couldn't be!
It couldn't be...
It couldn't be cuter!
It couldn't be Sena-san.
It could only be a trick of fate.
It counts.
It creates a happy crescendo
It'd almost be a waste to eat it.
It'd be a lie to say that there isn't
It'd be a waste if these
It'd be a waste if they were
It'd be best if she was
It'd be best if she were
it'd be fun to be a weather girl.
It'd be good for us if she could stay,
It'd be great if all
It'd be great if lots of people
It'd be great if someone just struck you,
It'd be great if someone struck
It'd be great if we could
It'd be great if we found something
It'd be lame if I asked her over the phone.
It'd be lovely if it snowed!
It'd be my loss if I didn't
It'd be nice if Kii-chan could go see him.
It'd be nice if we could.
It'd be nice if your pose stood
It'd be nice to give a feeling of comfort.
it'd be nice to wear something different.
it'd be perfect since the race starts at the shrine.
it'd be snowing every day.
it'd be snowing for sure.
- It'd be so cool if you got to be the Pon Pon crepe campaign girl! Rooting for you!
It'd be something special, wouldn't it?
It'd be strange for the
It depends on how strong your feelings are.
It'd help if we had a big speaker too.
It didn't happen when we
it didn't really heat him up.
It didn't seem as though her performance was
It didn't seem that way to me.
It didn't strike me as new.
It didn't take long for
It didn't work.
It'd look so great on you, Miyabi-chan.
it'd make everyone cheerful and happy that way.
It does!
It does.
It doesn't air until next week, but
It doesn't, and stop adding -chan!
It doesn't even have to be STAR☆ANIS...
It doesn't feel like it's our first time.
It doesn't give off the
It doesn't have to be big...
It doesn't look like anyone really understands
It doesn't matter if we mess up out there.
it doesn't matter unless you can find us
It doesn't matter who I'm acting with.
It doesn't matter who wins tomorrow.
it doesn't mean you won't get the part.
It doesn't really fit him.
It doesn't really matter
It doesn't say anything
It doesn't say anything about
It doesn't show at all, though.
It doesn't sound like me at all!
It does sound friendly, but still...
It does... sound fun.
It does sound like fun, but you know...
It does sound like the perfect
It does. Whether the applicants will be given offers of admission

It draws me back again and again.
It draws out your cute side.
It'd slipped my mind.
It'd sure be nice if it snowed this year.
it'd surprise the socks off Kokone-chan.
It embodies the little devil coord
It encompasses this entire cruise.
It even brought a smile to my face, too.
It even got me in the mood
It even made me happy!
it ever since you decided to enter.
It expresses each of us
It expresses exactly how she is.
It expresses Rin-chan's love of dance.
It express our differences
It feels a bit strange to
It feels a lot tighter and cool.
- It feels as if we needed enough courage to go on an adventure to meet the designer directly.
It feels as though there's a nice
It feels great!
It feels great.
It feels impertinent even to
It feels impertinent to even
It feels like a dream.

It feels like an autograph!
It feels like he never
It feels like I can hear my fans' voices.
It feels like if I'm with you,
It feels like I'm in the clouds
It feels like I'm missing something.
It feels like I saw you just last week.
It feels like it just began, too.
It feels like it makes the new year.
It feels like it's calling me
It feels like I've caught
It feels like just yesterday
It feels like my day's not complete
It feels like my heart is
It feels like my heart's
it feels like my heart stops
It feels like seeing them
It feels like she finally
It feels like she transferred
It feels like something's missing.
It feels like something's off.
It feels like such a waste to have
It feels like that's the first
It feels like the Aikatsu Sensei's
It feels like the answer was
It feels like the room heats up as soon
it feels like they're always here with us.
- It feels like things are going to get busy from now on.
It feels like this is a
It feels like this is where
It feels like today's
It feels like we just left Hokkaido for
It feels like yesterday she was struggling her
It feels like you're always
It feels like Yurika-chan is
It feels really good taking this
It feels really good when you make
It feels relaxing.
It feels so funny saying "Happy New
It feels so funny saying Happy New Year
It fell to pieces!
It felt as if the weight of
it felt as though the weight
It felt great to be on stage again.
It felt like if Soleil were a sunflower in full
It felt like someone was
it felt like something special.
it felt like you were
It felt realer than real.
It felt so good!
It fills me with happiness.
It finally feels like
It fits his naughtiness
It fits me perfectly!
It fits Otome-chan to a T!
It fits us perfectly.
It fits us way better than
It fits you to a T!
it for a special on me.
it for each individual customer.
it for our summer tour.
it for Starlight's party?
it from a distance, I understood.
It gave me goosebumps!
It gave me the urge to sing more, and
it gave me this pro-pro-production plan!
It gave off the scent of an idol!
It gets me that "so it's
It gets my recommendation!
It gives me goosebumps
It gives off an air of refinement.
It gives off a refined and mature air.
It gives you a shot in the
It goes by the name of...
it goes from spring to summer,
It goes great with rice!
It goes to show how hard you all worked.
It goes without saying that
It goes without saying that idols from
It goes without saying that once you become
It goes without saying that tomorrow's
It got quite exhausting at times.
it grew and grew until it
it grew and grew until it filled
It had a cute wrapping just like a present.
It had cute packaging, like a present.
I thank you as well. She's providing my
I thank you for coming.
I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
It happened long ago.
It happened! The number

It happened to you too?
It happened. We really
It happened when Yotsuba-san was having
It happened when you were in America.
It happens. Sometimes I accidentally
It happens to me when I dance too.

It has been called the
It has been years since they
It has eight points.
It has everything to do with me!
It has great personal significance to her.
It has nothing to do with you.
It hasn't been announced yet,
It hasn't been long, but
It hasn't been that long since you joined Starlight
It hasn't even been one minute yet.
It hasn't really sunk in yet.
It has quite the deep flavor.
It has to be fun to look at.
It has to be, if you say so...
It has to be top secret!
it has wide appeal or not...

I thought Aoi already knew
I thought bigger was better, too!

I thought I told you not to add -chan.
I thought it was about time to gather everyone
I thought it was so strange.
I thought it would improve our teamwork.
I thought I was prepared, but
I thought long and hard about how we could fulfill
I thought Madoka-chan and
I thought me and Madoka-chan
I thought might come in handy.
I thought of so many poses that

It is.
it is almost time to begin,

It is as you say...

It is because I'm not yet the sun?
It is because muses existed
It is because muses existed that artists
It is because of those experiences
It is facing and overcoming
It is finally time for our confrontation.

It's no lie!
It's Nono-chan and Risa-chan!
It's no prob.

It's no surprise you didn't hear
It's not!
It's not...
It's not a big deal or anything.
It's not about whether you win or lose. You
It's not a joke!
it's not all just for one person.
It's not any different from what
It's not a problem. A
It's not a problem of skill.
It's not a problem since
It's not as easy as you think.
It's not as if I can simply laugh without...
It's not as if I'm telling you
It's not as if I want you to teach
It's not a simple whim
It's not as simple as
It's not a Starlight Christmas
It's not as though I can
It's not as though I'm not
It's not enough.
It's not enough to simply be cute
It's not even a question if you're
It's not even your birthday, and

It's... nothing.
It's nothing important...
It's nothing like that.
It's nothing new.

It's not just the food we like.
It's not just their style.
It's not just the memories we have now.
It's not just to move the story along!
It's not like I became suddenly
It's not like I can just break
It's not like I didn't appreciate it...
It's not like I disagree...
It's not like I don't understand, though.
It's not like I'm actually talking to them,

It's not like you're not more amazing by being able to
It's not like you to make a mistake.

than take the safe choice of sliding into first.
than them I'd have to work.
than the one and only Kanzaki Mizuki-san!
than there are holes in that mic.
than the third verse of this song.
than the videos we saw.
than they can even imagine!
than usual because of the Aikatsu Caravan?
than usual or something?
than usual performances with her.
than usual, though.
than we'd anticipated.
than your character.
than you thought, right?
Thass' right! I'm Doujima Nina, ya know!
Thass' right! I'm the
That!
That?!
That?
that ability "top idols".
that a bit much, even for you?
That accessory did the trick.
that adorable reaction is irresistible!
that all into half a day?
that allow idols to move fans' hearts.
that all these people here
That almost never happens.
That along with becoming high school idols,
That also means I need to
That also means that we wouldn't not have to
That always cheered me up since
That amount of radiance
that, and still is today.
That answer is revealed by the
that Aoi-sama's advice is never wrong.
that appear within old myths.
That appetite of yours must be
That area is always crowded with people.
That area is always extremely
that are ethnic, western...
that are giving me energy now!
that are opening up right in front of us.
that are pushing me forward too.
that are supposed to make me shine.
that arise from rock satisfy me.
that artists were able to
that a secret, right?
- That aside, I do want to set a more proper goal.
that Asuka-san taught me.
that a top designer has approved of you.
That attempt ended in failure.
that audition for new students?
That aura!
That aura of yours is overwhelming!
That back and forth between performers and the
that badly by this Yurika-sama?
That bath felt really nice.
That became our dream without
that because you're hungry.
that before you came in.
That being the case...
that belongs to nobody but yourself.
That bench looks good for a backdrop.
That bench was one of our traps!
that between the moon and a soft-shelled turtle.
that blew away our exhaustion.
that blew through my heart.
that blew us right off our feet.
That brings back memories.
that brings it all together!
That bunny is quite skillfully folded.
That burger was so juicy and delicious...
that, but to be quite honest,
- That by fusing two completely different stars together, you can achieve an even greater brilliance.
that cafe for breakfast with Miya,
That cake's really nice.
that came my way, so I trained myself to suppress it.
that can make anyone smile.
that can make everyone happy.
that can make these idols rejoice.
that can stand up to any TV show.
That cat outfit looks great on you!
That cat's already out of the bag.
That certainly is a home party.
That certainly sounds like a lot of fun.
That climax was amazing.
that close to Ichigo too, wasn't it?
That cold-hearted type of
That concert was amazing
That concludes all of our units for today.
That concludes our backstage report.
That concludes our spring
That concludes Shirakaba
That concludes the four
That concludes the second day
That concludes the sorting contest!
that conveys everyone's
That conveys gratitude
That conveys my gratitude toward them.
that could be more exciting.
That could work.
that crowns the top idol at Starlight,
That dance worked up a sweat.
That day is forever
That day, I was able to answer
That day's promise remains
That day three years ago, I saw
that day were brilliant.
that day were dazzling.
that dazzling concert that Mizuki-san put on,
That'd be really impressive.
That'd be something really special.
That decides the theme.
That decides what'll
that defines Luminas.
That depends on Double M.
That depends on what Double M does.
That didn't take long.
That didn't take long to get around.
That didn't work.
That'd just break apart
That'd make me happy too.
That does look good.
That does make sense considering
That doesn't get us anywhere.
That doesn't help!
That doesn't matter a bit.
That doesn't mean that our
That doesn't mean the same
that doesn't mean we're going to pat each
that doesn't not make me happy.
That doesn't sound like Ichigo to me.
That doesn't sound much
That doesn't tell us anything
That does seem to suit you both.
That does sound nice!
that don't need to change, you know?
that Double M was formed.
that dream with you, Ichigo.
that each have their own charms,
that each of us was already walking
That each of us were already walking
that easy to get accepted.
That Emblem Hair Accessory did her well.
That ends another fun day of work.
That ends today's forecast!
That ends today's recording.
that ends up at the top.
That enough!
that entails, though...
That even if we can't see them,
That event caused a huge
That event was announced via
That every customer should
- that everyone
that everyone
- That everyone - that everyone
that everyone was comparing me with my mother.
that everyone was just comparing me to my mother.
that everyone was safe and sound.
that everyone will admire!
that exist deep in everyone
That experience will
That explains her absence.
That explains her applause...
That explains it.
That explains it. I'm glad
That explains it! I've heard all
That explains why none of
That explains why you hear about celebrities always going
That explains why you speak...
That explains why you've been practicing
that expresses all of our different traits.
That expression became so familiar that
- That expression became so familiar that I didn't think of it as strange.
- That expression became so familiar to me that I didn't even recognize it as strange.
That failed.
That failed. Sumire-chan wasn't
That fall was a bit too real, but
That famous chef will
that famous TV star? Actually,
- That fashion sense is something you're born with.
That feeling of longing gets washed away
That felt awesome, right Mizuki?
That felt great!
That few?
That first step felt unbearably heavy.
that first step when I was still timid.
That gap is their best point.
That girl...
That girl had the same one
That girl has also
That girl is...
That girl is a linchpin.
That girl is always so much cuter
That girl... right! She's
That girl... right! She's Otoshiro Seira!
That girl's amazing!
That girl's amazing.
- That girl's coordination was really nice.
That girl's from our class...
That girl's outfit is
- That girl's outfit's really well put together.
That girl there is popular
That girl truly loves
That girl was Ichigo.
that goal alongside Mizuki herself.
That goes for all of us here.
That goes for both us and our fans.
That goes for me too. You two
that got stuck up in the tree?
that guitar riff you just let out, wasn't there?!
That happened?
that happened during my time in Masquerade.
That happened for me too.
That has an idol-y ring to it!
that has been supporting me all this way.
That has nothing to do with how
That has nothing to do with it.
that has something for each of us.
That headmistress is hiding something.
that Headmistress Orihime mentioned?
That helps me focus.
that helps when you're sick.
that he put into making that dress.
That here at Starlight Academy...
that he wouldn't approve of your music.
that his new dress has yet to
that hold heat exceptionally...
That... huh?
That hurt, you know.
that I,
that I am unable to bring
that I am unable to bring out the Kitaouji Theater.
that I can hardly take idly standing by!
that I can proudly call myself a chef.
that I can run my hardest.
that I can't accept them.
that I can teach these students.
that I can't even begin to record it all.
that I can't help but want to climb her!
that I can't help pushing her buttons.
that I change a bit every day
that Ichigo-sama's by my side.
that Ichigo-sama will be by my side.
That Ichigo sure knows how to do things.
that I couldn't even lie down on it.
that I couldn't give up
that I could see that face.
that I'd be suited for idolhood.
That idea of Ichigo-chan's
that I decided to just go for it.
that I didn't eat on the plane at all.
that I didn't get to eat much.
that I'd like to talk about with you.
That I do!
that idols all have scents.
that I don't fall over like last time.
that I'd suck their blood if they didn't show up.
that I ended up in second.
that I even surprised myself.
that if I talked to you,
that if they couldn't get enough fans,
that I had forgotten something important.
that I had never even imagined.
that I had to get better first.
that I haven't a clue where to begin.
that I have to enter!
that I just had to try singing it.
that I know who the guest is.
that I know who the guest it.
that I'll use to start a new Aikatsu.
that I love the most.
That I might.
that I might not be able to sleep tonight.
That I'm "interesting".
that I'm keeping up with my dancing.
That I'm not Mizuki.
that I'm overflowing with motivation.
that I'm pumped and ready to go!
That I mustn't wear them halfheartedly.
- That includes me too, of course.
That includes our encounters with each other,
That information is all useless, though.
That in itself will cause
That in itself would cause
that inspired me to become an idol.
That is...
that is after all our concerts.
That is a masterpiece, Otome-sama.
That is a pretty good
That is a unit.
That is correct. I will exert all efforts to live
that is fun in its own way.
That island... really is...
That is linked to your
That is my greatest happiness.
That is my true happiness.
That is, of course, really important,
That is precisely how Shibuki was able to become a

That I would do everything in my power to turn
that I would one day try to become the Starlight Queen.
That Johnny-sensei.
that Johnny-sensei is getting married?
That just goes to show how
That just leaves us.
That just means I need to aim

That kind of idol.
That kind of love fuels you.
that kind of negate the freshness Juri wants?
That kind of partner.
That kind of stuff.
that King-san came to see him!
That last one's just Hoshimiya-senpai!
That laugh isn't my Aoi!

That leaves Ichigo in
That leaves the rest of us free to focus
That led to this inspiration!
That legendary drama's coming back!
That legendary event, the

That'll do it for today's recording.
That'll end the filming too...
That'll make them unique.
That logo is just the best!
That looked like a high-level appeal
That look in your eyes...

That means a lot.
That means a lot coming from you.

That might be the reason I took a

that much while we were running,
That must be it.
That must be unimaginably
That must be why I can't be
That must be why they
That must be why they've soared so high.

that my eyes were spinning.
that my partner is the Starlight Queen!
That nameless emotion is
That Natsuki Mikuru has the ability to
that nervous since her debut.
that nervous since her first debut.
That never crossed my mind.
That new appeal you did was called
That news is abuzz around
that New Year's gig.
That nickname is so adorable!
That night, I saw Ichigo-chan giving
that nobody might get in.
that no matter how far apart you may be,
that nothing here will change
that nothing was wrong.
That obviously the ultra sexy Japan beauty!
That okay?
that omelettes were removed from the menu.
That one actually fell apart right
That one day, the two of us would
That one ended in failure.
That one really looked like him!
That one's from Dreamy Crown.
That one's no good. Do it over.
That one's so pretty!
that only fellow dancers can share.
that only idols can use.
that only new idols try out for Swallowtail.
that only the chosen can walk through.
that only the chosen may attain.
that on Sumire-chan's advice?
That openness must be why Dream Academy
That other school is going to
that Otome loves best.
That party was a blast.
That party was so much fun!
that performance most of all.
That performance was amazing!
"That person"?
That person is all you can think about,
That place might...
that point perfectly.
That pony is so cute!
that power together.
- That precious letter helped me through so many things.
That precious letter supported
that precious thing is?
that precipitous cliff to demonstrate their resolve.
That public challenge was nuts!
That pulls me through the
That puts Ichigo in the Paw Print coord...
that Ran, along with Sora-chan from our rival school, Dream Academy,
that Ran liked healthy food.
that Ran will come to us.
that rare type of bedhair is her special trait,
That reaction is exactly why I chose them.
That reaction makes you look like
That really brings back memories...
That really brings back memories.
That really calms me down.
That really hurt, you know!
That really is a lot.
That really must be a
That really surprised me.
That reminds me...
That reminds me of something I once heard.
That reminds me of yesterday...
That reminds me! Yotsuba-san's
- that reward
that right after becoming
that right after entering, such an
That right. I have to put in enough effort for
That right. I was able to act in
That right then... it couldn't have been...
That rocker is a dream girl.
That Rocker is a Dream☆Girl
That's!
That's...
That's a beautiful way to lose.
that's a bit far from here.
That's a bit too subdued a name for Kitty.
- That's a bit too subdued of a name for a Neko-tan.
That's a bit unexpected.
that's a bit weird for idols...
That's absolute taste for you!
That's a completely different thing.
That's a cute name.
That's adorable!
That's a good choice.
That's a good idea.
That's a good idea to
That's a good picture.
That's a good thing!
That's a good thing for idols.
That's a good thing! I'm sure your power comes
That's a good way to look at it.
That's a great name, yeah!
That's a huge emergency!
That said...
That said, a strong electric front...
That said, I really just made the design,
That said, it's true that we
That said, since we don't have much
That said, since we don't have much time,
That said, we barely had
That said, we still don't have any concrete ideas
That's a key facet of
That Sakurairo Kaden dress is perfect
- That Sakurairo Kaden dress is perfect on you, Miyabi-chan! - Fujiwara Miyabi-chan has such a unique aura. I'm totally a fan now!
That's a lie.
That's all, folks.
That's all, folks. Take care on
That's all part of who Natsuki Mikuru is.
That's all! That's the last one!
That's all there is to it!
That's all well and good,
That's all well and good, but
That's all well and good, but they
That's all well and good, but why are the three
That's all work though, right?
That's all you need to know.
That's all you've been
That's a long history... huh?
That's a long list!
That's a lot of pressure.
That's a lot of sweat.
That's a lot you got there.
That's a lot you've got there.
That's a lovely expression, Shinjou.
That's alright.
That's a magnificent tree!
That's a Mastery that you should
That's a mature thing to say.
That's amazing!
That's amazing.
That's amazing, Aoi.
That's amazing, but her character...
That's amazing! Congrats, Hinaki-chan.
That's amazing, good job.
That's amazing. Good job!
That's amazing, Hinaki-chan!
That's amazing. I got lost in your playing.
That's amazing, Mizuki!
That's amazing, Ran. Even in disguise,
That's amazing, Shion-sama!
That's amazing. So we
That's amazing. What's it like?
That's an elegant way of putting it.
That's an exaggeration.
That's a nice expression.
That's an idol's Love You power!
That's a no!
That's another one of her good points.
That's a pretty good
That's a pretty weak reaction.
That's a pro for you.
That's a really difficult question.
That's a really wide range of activities.
That's a rock star for you.
That's a secret until it begins.
That's a silly question.
That's asking the impossible. I take as
That's a testament to
That's a tradition passed on
That's a very real possibility.
That's a vital part of the theme.
That's a weather forecaster for you.
That's awesome!
That's awesome, Akari-chan!
That's awesome! Thank you!
That's a wonderful realization.
That's a wonderful story.
That's barely different.
That's because...
That's because I am.
That's because I convinced Sena
That's because I might be
That's because it was my own mansion...
That's because Ran's favorite brand,
That's because today's me is acting
that's been on my mind.
That's bothering you?
That's called a tortilla.
that's called "show stocking".
That scandal's going to
That scandal's going to just
That scared me!
That's certainly a lot of pressure.
That's certainly important.
That's certainly true.
That's certainly you.
That's chemistry, Headmistress.
That's classified information.
That's clever.
That's correct.
That's correct, I have a
That's correct. I will exert all efforts to live
That's correct. The highest-ranked SA appeal
That's correct. The highest rank SA appeal
That's crazy cutthroat!
That's Dandai's catchphrase, isn't it?
That's definitely an Ichigo answer.
That's DreAca!
That's Dream Academy!
that seek the truth,
That seems a bit...
That's Elizabeth III.
That's enough!
That's enough.
That's enough for me.
That's enough. Get a room, you two.
That's enough, I need to
That's enough. Let's just
- That's enough of games
- That's enough of games - jirasanaide
That's enough outta you!
That's enough! Warm-ups are now over.
that set your heart ablaze?!
that set your heart on fire?
That's everyone.
That's exactly it! If we could just find out
That's exactly it! If we could just find out the
That's exactly right!
That's exactly right.
That's exactly what a leader's job is.
That's exactly what I just said.
That's exactly what I thought.
That's exactly why we usually avoid them.
That's exciting!
That's fantastic!
That's fine, but...
That's fine, but are you feeling better?
That's fine, but is your arm alright?
That's fine, I guess.
That's fine. There's a
That's fine with me. If you look at it
That's fine with me. Put another way,
That's for you to think over.
That's freshness for you.
that's getting closer. What?
That's giant squid sushi!
That's gonna be mightily exciting!
That's gonna go down in
That's good!
That's good.
That's good. And you're not hurt?
That's good, but I guess it
That's good, but I guess it isn't
That's good enough.
that's good for sick people.
- That's good fortune.
That's good... huh? Where did it go?
That's got to be from watching Akari-chan.
That's got to come from
That's great!
That's great.
That's great and all,
That's great and all, but
That's great, Aoi!
That's great! He's sure to help us come
That's great, Ichigo!
That's great! It's so us!
That's great. I wanted to
That's great, keep going like that.
That's great, let's do it!
That's great! Let's help get
That's great! Let's help them
That's great, Mikuru-chan!
That's great, Rin-chan!
That's great, Risappe! You'll
That's great! Sunnys!
That's great too! It's so fresh!
That's great... yeah, I really like it!
That's hardly shorter.
That's harsh.
that she accidentally used my name,
that she'd be halting all her idol activities.
that she'd be there listening in person.
That she does.
That she gave me my dream!
That she has an amazing power.
that she hasn't had time for class.
that she isn't not cheering you on.
that she might start her own brand.
That's her background. She calls
That's herbal tea. I hoped it
That's herbal tea. I was hoping
That's her character.
that she really did have the air of an idol.
that she was shipped off to Aikatsu Boot Camp.
that she was so good.
That's Hikami Sumire, who released
That's Hikari. Minowa Hikari.
That's Hikari's style.
That's hilarious for reals!
that shines on all the idols in this world
that shining bubble off
That shining stage was forever
that Shion-sama may come in time.
that showcases the best of what the
That's how daring I am!
That's how I live my life.
That's how I realized this
That's how it is.
that shows where the stolen chocolate is.
That's how they know each other.
That's how you build up
That's how you ended up inviting me here.
That's how your vampire
That's Ichigo-chan's event!
That's impossible!
That's impossible, you know...
That's incredible!
That's incredible, Madoka-chan!
That's interesting.
That's interesting. You said you met
That's it!
That's it?
That's it! Akari-chan, do
That's it! Excuse me!
That's it for the rehearsal. Good work!
That's it for today's lesson.
That's it for today's meeting.
That's it for today's news!
That's it for today's shoot!
That's it! I'm in love with that kitty!
That's it! I'm in love with that Neko-tan!
That's it! Just because she's leaving
- That's it! Just because she's leaving doesn't mean we have to say goodbye.
That's it! Just like that!
That's it, Madoka-chan!
That's it. That's the precious
- That's it! There's no need to part with a farewell.
That's it! This dress is so cute!
That's Juri-chan for you.
That's just a coincidence.
That's just a silly pun!
That's just how things
That's just like absolute pitch.
That's just like Ichigo.
That's just like Mizuki-chan! She's already
That's just like you.
That's just like you, Akari-chan.
That's just like you, Ichigo.
That's just like you, Otome-chan!
That's just one of Akari-chan's charms.
That's just way too special!
That's just what you want to eat.
That's kinda cool, Mizuki.
That's lacking too much impact, yeah.
That slight air of mystery is
That slight blush is adorable too!
that slight possibility real.
That's like, totally a rip of the coord
That's lookin' good.
That's lovely!
That's lovely.
That's making me want to try even harder.
That's me!
That's me.
That's means we can't use
That's means you'll be able to apply too,
That's Megu-chan!
That's me. I'm going to be your mentor
That smells nice.
That smile...
That's Mizuki-chan.
That's Mizuki-chan's song!
That's Mizuki for you.
That's Mizuki-san's new agency.
That's Mizuki-san's partner?
That's more like a gentle breeze.
That's more like it.
That's more like it, Ichigo.
That's more like it— nothing
That's more like it—nothing
That's my...
That's my aim. If we used these...
That's my Akari-chan.
That's my Aoi!
That's my aura.
That's my dream.
That's my family's helicopter.
That's my goal as an idol.
That's my Ichigo!
That's my Ichigo-tan!
That's my Mikuru.
That's my mission.
That's my one wish these precious days
that's my pinky promise to the future
That's my policy.
That's my proposal.
That's my way of being an idol.
That's my way of swordsmanship.
That's news to me.
That's New Year's Day.
That's nice to hear.
That's nice to hear! Go
That's Nina, ya know!
That's no good, Sakura-chan!
That's none of your business.
That's Nono-chan and Risa-chan.
That's no problem at all.
That's no surprise.
That's not...
That's not about me.
That's not a compliment!
That's not a figure
That's not all there is.
That's not even a good pun!
That's not exactly it...
That's not good.
That's not good enough.
That's nothing like an aphorism!
That's nothing to apologize for. I love it.
That's not how it works...
That's not important here...
That's not it...
That's not it. Don't you
That's not it, Ichigo-sama.
That's not it, it's just better for
That's not really a punishment.
That's not really a secret either...
That's not really a secret either.
That's not right.
That's not something you eat!
That's not the case at all.
That's not the Hoshimiya
That's not the only reason.
That's not the problem, Ichigo-sama.
That's not true.
That's not true at all! And besides,
That's not very idol-like.
That's not what he means
That's not what I...
That's not what I mean...
That's not what I mean.
That's not what I mean! I'm talking
That's not what I was going for!
That's not what I was talking about.
That's not what she meant...
That's not what you should be saying.
That's not what you should be watching...
That's not why! I just got
That's not why I said that...
That's obviously the
That's okay, I was just so
That so. Knock 'em dead!
That solves that mystery.
that something so unbelievable
That's Onee-chan, right?
That's one of Osaka's specialties,
That's one of the things
That's one reason, but I've also been
That's one thing about
That's one way to look at it.
That song!
That song must mean a lot to you.
That's only because there's
That's only if we manage to pass.
that sort of background.
That sort of filthy activity isn't necessary for a being
That sort of filthy activity is unnecessary for a being
That sort of stuff has nothing to do with
That sound... could it be?
That sounds cool!
That sounds fun!
That sounds fun.
That sounds good!
That sounds good. I'll try talking
That sounds good to me.
That sounds great!
That sounds great.
That sounds hot!
That sounds impossible!
That sounds incredible!
That sounds interesting!
That sounds just like Akari-chan.
That sounds like a big downgrade in scale.
That sounds like a luxurious home party!
That sounds like an SOS.
That sounds like fun!
That sounds like he gave you the go-ahead!
That sounds like it'd be really fun.
That sounds like something out of a dream.
That sounds lovely! Let's have tea!
That sounds nice.
That sounds nice. It's
That sounds plausible!
That sounds pretty good.
That sounds really hard.
That sounds right.
That sounds so cool.
That sounds so incredible!
That sounds wonderful.
That source being blood orange juice.
That's our goal!
That's our job as models.
That's our Juri-senpai!
That's our Kanzaki Mizuki.
That's our last promotion for today.
That's our Otome-chan!
That's our PowaPuri.
That's our Princess Two!
That's our third A rank appeal today.
That's our third A-rank appeal today.
That's our Yurika-tan.
That's part of my main dish!
That's part of what makes you great.
That's part of why PowaPuri's so popular.
That's part of why this house is so great.
That's perfect for Juri.
That's perfect! Idols are made of passion!
That's perfect! Time to put
That's plenty insane!
That's plenty, Madoka-chan.
that's polished her skills to contend for the top!
- That's positive fortune-telling.
That's positive reading.
That's pretty amazing.
That's pretty bold.
That's pretty good for someone so new.
That's pretty great for someone so new.
That's pretty intense.
That's pretty much how the meeting went.
That's pretty nice, and the
That's pretty poetic.
That's pretty rare.
That's pretty spot on.
That's probably true.
That's probably why. Adults and the elderly
That's proof that they're already perfect
That's quince honey tea.
That's quite alright, Juri-chan.
That's quite alright, Juri-chan. It
That's quite the confidence.
That's quite the name...
That's quite the pace.
That's rare.
That's really admirable.
That's really amazing!
that's really different from you.
That's really fresh!
that's really good.
That's really impressive.
That's really interesting.
That's really rare for Ichigo...
That's really reassuring.
That's really worldwide!
That's reassuring to hear.
That's ridiculous! You need to stay in bed.
- That's right!
That's right!
That's right...
That's right.
That's right, Aikatsu girls.
That's right. Akari-chan
That's right. Akari-chan has
That's right. All good
That's right, all of you.
That's right. All the girls before me
That's right. All we know about her
That's right. Also,
That's right. And it's not just
That's right, and now
That's right. And only very
That's right. And the brand
That's right. And this is the first job I
That's right! A raging schedule awaits!
That's right. Are you asking
That's right, back then
That's right, because it'll
That's right, because it's your turn next.
That's right. Both Shibuki Ran
That's right! But I'm the type to

That's right. I can still remember you
That's right, Ichigo.
That's right, Ichigo's graduating now...
That's right, I don't really get how to use my
That's right. I don't want people to think that I was
That's right. I don't want people to think that I was chosen
That's right! If I'm more famous, I should be
That's right! If you pass this audition,
That's right, I get
That's right! I-It's the...
That's right! I know exactly how you feel.
That's right! I'll do
That's right. I made it myself.
That's right! I'm a student here too!
That's right. I'm getting interviewed

That's right. It might be
That's right. It might be something it
That's right, it's all based
That's right. It's all over if you give up.
That's right, it's a lot of hard work.
That's right. It's important
That's right, it's nothing to worry about.
That's right, it's not like Yurika-sama
That's right. It's the
That's right. It's the same brand that wanted
That's right. It's time for
That's right, it's you.
That's right, it was exactly
That's right. I've spent too much
That's right. I wanted
That's right. I was sent to this school as a spy
That's right... I wonder what kind
That's right. I, Yurika-sama,
That's right, Juri-chan.
That's right. Let's go ahead and change
- That's right. Mikuru-san, you're still a gardener on top of being an idol.
That's right, Mizuki-san!
That's right! New Year's Eve means the
That's right. Next year
That's right! Noelle is our secret weapon!
That's right! Once I'm famous, a lot of
That's right! Once I showed them the

That's right. Please tell us about
That's right! PowaPuri is Love You!

That's right. Riding the wave of their
That's right, Seira.
That's right. She came from Kobe's Etoile
That's right. She'll always be herself.
That's right. She's from Kobe's Etoile
That's right. So...
That's right! That's definitely
That's right. That's why I was so happy
That's right. That's why we want to do
That's right. That was our team's dream.
That's right! The DanDiva
That's right. The sponsors have
That's right! The very same famous actress!
That's right, they did.
That's right. They're the
That's right, they were long since
That's right! This isn't a parting,
That's right! This isn't the first
That's right. This is the first job I want
That's right, this Yurika-sama
That's right. Three years ago,
That's right. We can only shine because
That's right! We can't give up here!
That's right! We can watch it in our room.
That's right. We figured that since
That's right. We love hearing back what everyone
That's right! We're counting
That's right. We're looking forward to
That's right! We're supposed to
That's right, we should
That's right, we've got two
That's right. We were just talking about how we
That's right! Whenever
That's right. You are
That's right! You can leave
That's right. You have a job offer.
That's right. You know who I am?
That's right, you must
That's right. You recognize who I am?
That's seriously special!
That's Shibuki Ran.

That's so interesting.
That's so like you!
That's so lovely!
That's some honesty.
That's some matchup...

That's something I can understand.
That's something I'm very envious of.
That's something new.
that's something special.
That's something special!
That's something special.
That's something we all realized
That's something you don't see every day.
That's somethin' special!
That's some yummy-looking chocolate!
That's so much data!
That's so nerve-wracking!
That's so nice.
"That's so pretty..."
That's so pretty!
That's Sora-chan and Maria-chan.
That's so right!
That's so strange. The dress Sena-san
That's so strange. They should've just
That's so useful! It really
That's so you.
That's Starlight Academy's ideal.
That's Starlight Academy's purpose.
that's still bothering me.
That's still bothering you?

That's the bell we used to ring whenever
That's the best dress
That's the best part!
That's the best part about her.
That's the best possible way to
That's the candidness I was talking about.
That's the Christmas tree that
That's the concept Masquerade had in mind.
That's the Constellation Appeal.
That's the direction where a goddess
- That's the direction where a goddess called Toshitokujin currently
That's the energy drink
That's the essence of an idol.
That's the first I've heard of it.
That's the first time
That's the formula for us
That's the fun part, how
That's the good part.
That's the good part about her.
That's the greatest spice of them all.
That's the Ichigo that I love.
That's the ideal Masquerade
That's the keystone of this promotion.
That's the kind of idol I want to be.
That's the kind of Starlight
That's the last audition
That's the legendary dorm...
That's the legendary oxygen mask she used
That's the limit of her exchange period..
That's them!
That's them.
That's the mark of a top actress, isn't it?
That's the meaning behind it.
That's the meaning I want it to have.
That's the most exciting part!
That's the most important ability
That's the most important thing.
That's the one problem.
That's the one thing I have
That's the only building
That's the only way up the winding
That's the outline for 2wingS outfits that we
That's the perfect expression!
That's the place you went to meet the
That's the plan for the 2wingS outfits we're
That's the power of fashion.
That's the promise we made to each other
That's the reason I became an idol.
That's the reason I came to this school.
That's the reason I can work so hard.
That's the reason I decided
That's the reason we're so determined
That's the reason you
That's the rule.
That's the same as us!
That's the same as when you're on stage.
That's the same thing I'm
That's the same with me!
That's the scariest garden in the world.
That's the side of Ichigo-tan
That's the Snow Relay Project!
That's the spirit!
That's the spirit, Kurosawa-honey.
That's the Starlight Tiara!
That's the unpredictability
that still won't be enough.
That's too bad...
That's too bad.
that stood out from the rest.
That's too harsh, Ran.
That's too late.
That's too little impact, yeah.
That's too many!
That's too much to ask for...
That's too reckless.
That's top secret.
That's totally ok-ok-okay!
That's totally possible!
that straight from you.
That's true.
That's true, but...
That's true, but even more amazing is that Mizuki-chan's
That's true, but I also think that Ichigo-chan
That's true, but I owe it all to Minami.
That's true, but so's the amount
That's true. By that time, all I remembered
That's true. I can't see it any other way.
That's true. This is, like,
That's true. This is totally
That's true. We're still far from
That style really suits you.
That sucks!
that Sumire-chan's advice?
That's unbelievable.
That's unexpectedly normal.
That's unfortunate.
That super cool Aoi-senpai
That sure was close.
That sure was fun.
That sure was nervewracking.
That sure was scary.
That surprised me.
That's us.
that's very much like you all.
that's very special to you.
That's very true.
That's weird.
That's weird, I was certain
That's we we do these guerilla

that's what everyone calls you.
That's what excites me the most.
That's what I believe.
That's what I believe to be the
That's what I call Oozora...
That's what I can say now because
That's what I expected.
That's what I find so great about you!
That's what I like about Hoshimiya-senpai.
That's what I'm going for.

That's what they told me, too. I'm not
That's what we call omelettes in Spain.
That's what we should aim for.
That's what what is?
That's what you'd normally think, right?
That's what you get for misspeaking.
That's what you wanted to say, right?
That's when I decided!
That's when I decided that I couldn't let
That's when I decided to become
That's when I found Ebipon.
That's when I got the idea of being a princess
